### Heat Map Interpolation
**This was an internship project created by Haiming (Eric) Xu during his internship from 05/2020 to 08/2020.**

The HeatMapInterpolationPoints class allows developers to input a sparse data set or data set with given intensities and outputs an array of GMUWeightedLatLng. Points in the returned array are calculated points not found in the given data that with intensities set based on the inverse distance weights interpolation algorithm.
