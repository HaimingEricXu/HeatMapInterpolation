### Heat Map Interpolation
**This was an internship project created by Haiming (Eric) Xu during his internship from 05/2020 to 08/2020.**

The HeatMapInterpolationPoints class allows developers to input a sparse data setand outputs an array of GMUWeightedLatLng. Points in the returned array are points not found in the given data with intensities set based on the average intensities of the given points, calculated using the inverse distance weights interpolation algorithm.
